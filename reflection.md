Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Yaya Callahan (At the 2/15 TA), Ashby
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
   TA (2/15 7-9 PM), Office hours (2/17)
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Much easier to use than Python in terms of OO work, but I like Python much better in general
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I feel like my brain works better in a procedural fashion than OOP, but I appreciate how contained Java can be. Now that I'm working in Java, I recognize the common techniques for looping moreso, especially through talking with Yaya, who has a much more streamlined code
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I didn't know that I should iterate through each word, but now that I know, it makes much more sense! I would tell someone to go to office hours asap!
